## Contribution

When forking this repo it's important to uncheck the box from the `Copy the master branch only` option.
This way all the tags from this repo will be transferred to your fork and the builder would know latest mod version.
If you don't do this you wouldn't enter the world, because waila will think you're using a too old version of the mod.
